//String length counts the total space in a string
const string = "this is"
console.log(string.length);//output asbe 7 including space


//Array and objects are mutable in javascript but string are immutable.
//Immutable means it can not be changed by reasigning the specific index of the string. (this will construct a new string)
const immutableJs = 'SubhanAllah'
immutableJs[0] = "B";
console.log(immutableJs)


// we can not mutate the string bu we can concatenate the string as a value.
let gari = 'Ena';
gari = gari + ' Poribohon';
